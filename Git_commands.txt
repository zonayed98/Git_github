This file is created with 'touch' command. 



Note: We should create file/folders in 'working derectory' then connect it with 'stage' and then connect with local derectory.

- To see the location of cmd file = pwd
- To initialize the git file = git init
- To uninitialize the git file = rm -rf .git
- To check the directory data = ls
- To check the directory hidden data = ls -a
- To create a folder = mkdir
- To create a file = touch
- To clear the the page data = ctrl+l
- To change the derectory = cd (foldername)
- To go back the derectory folder = cd ..
- To check the git file status = git status
- To check the git username/email = git config / git config --list
- To check the git username = git config user.name "username"
- To check the git email = git config user.name "email"
- To trake/stage git from derctory = git add (filename+extension)
- To trak/stage all git file from derectory = git add .
- To unstage git file = git rm --cached (filename)
- To discard the git changes = git restore (filename)
- To see the modifications = git diff

- To take frome stage to local derectory = git commit -m "any massage"
- To take from working derctory to stage and commit together = git add . && git commit -m "any value"
- To check the commit history = git log
- To uncommit only = git reset --soft HEAD^
- To uncommit and unstage together = git reset HEAD^
- To delete the hole file = git reset --hard HEAD^
= git reset using is'nt the best way. We can use "git checkout" insted of "git reset"
- To check commit history in oneline = git log --oneline
- To undo or redu = git checkout (commit id)
- To ignore any file or folder from git staging = create .ignore file and move them


- To connect from local repo to remote repo = git remote add origin (github repo link)
- To remove any folder and desconnect from github = rm -rf Life-story 
- To clone directly from github without local repo = git clone (github repo link)

- To push the changes from the local to remote = git push -u origin (branch name)
- To pull changes from the remote to local repo = git pull
- To make a new branch = git branch (Branch name)
- To check the all branchs = git branch
- To move from one branch to another one = git chechout (Brach name)
- To delete branch = git branch -d (Branch name)
- To make a new brach and swithc instead = git checkout -b "Branch name"
- To merge the branchs, Switch to main branch then = git merge (Branch name)
- Then pull and push into the remote repo = git pull = git push -u origin main

- To open the current folder = start .
- To rename the master branch = git branch -m "main" (best way to rename from github then pull into the local)



- To stage and commit togather = git commit -am "massage"
